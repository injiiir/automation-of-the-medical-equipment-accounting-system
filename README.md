Medical equipment accounting system. Created as part of the final qualifying work for the Faculty of Physics and Technology of KubSU. 
This work presents the accounting system itself, as well as a tg-bot for transmitting important information between medical personnel and engineers within 1 hospital. 
There are some problems with the tg-bot, as some problems were identified during testing. 
Due to lack of time, only 1-3 commands for the bot had to be left.
